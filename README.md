# 🚀 What's New in v3.03 — PRO Mode Upgrades

**Secret Memory Locker v3.03** expands the **PRO mode** with groundbreaking features:

### 🌱 SecretML-Seed
- **SecretML-Seed (12)** — A **12-word seed phrase** generated entirely from your memories. No physical storage required — your mind becomes the secure vault.  
- **SecretML-Seed (24)** — Maximum entropy with a **24-word seed phrase**. Full control, maximum security, and no need to ever write anything down.  

### 🔑 Core Idea
Your **memories + your archive** generate the **final entropy**.  
This means your security lives only in your head — not on paper, not on devices.

- In reality, they are trapped in a **digital maze**, wasting time and resources while your true data remains **untouched and secure**.  

### 🛡 Key Advantage
MirageLoop creates an **illusion of progress** while ensuring that **no real data is ever exposed to risk**.  

---
👉 Try it yourself: enter a wrong answer and watch **SML MirageLoop** in action.

## 🚀 v2.22 – Offline AI Generation Mode  

### ✨ Added
- **New AI-powered mode:** `generate_offline`  
  - Create security questions **locally** using world-class templates.  
  - Pick from an **infinite pool** of questions to build a unique, strongly encrypted archive.  

### 🔧 Improved
- **100% local processing** — no data ever leaves your device.  
- **Flexible question selection** with fully customizable templates.  
- **Backward compatibility** with all previous SecretML archives.

# 🚧 Coming Soon  

## ✨ New Features in SecretMemoryLocker

---

### 🌀 **SML MirageLoop (SML-ML)**  
*Extended security mode – AI-powered illusion defense.*  

🔐 **How it works**  
When an incorrect answer is entered, instead of decrypting anything,  
the system launches an **infinite loop of AI-generated questions** from a secure local base,  
creating the **illusion of progress without touching real data**.  

🤖 **AI-controlled functions**:  
- Checks the **length** of the user's response.  
- **Syllable-level analysis** for realistic reaction.  
- Endless flow of **dynamic, template-based questions**.  

💡 **Advantages**:  
- Confuses and delays potential attackers.

SecretMemoryLocker v2.12 

🛠 Changelog – v2.12 (2025-07-28)
Fixes & Improvements:

🧩 Fixed UTF-8 filename issue when extracting files with non-Latin characters (e.g., Cyrillic).

📐 Fixed window sizing bug for smaller screen resolutions and DPI settings.

---

## 🆕 What's New in v2.11

🦾 🔒 Version 2.11 introduces a new encryption method **SHA256 Secure Mode-SML**, a patented encryption system that does not require memorizing a password phrase.

### Key features:
- The encryption process uses both the hash of the file (`file_hash`) and your answers.
- Security is independent of the question length — without the core (`file_hash`), brute-force is impossible.
- `file_hash` is stored in the ZIP archive comment as a separate key in the format **SHA256:<hash>**.
- Think of the JSON file as the key and the archive comment as the lock's core — without the core, the lock cannot be opened.
- All data is securely locked: having the JSON and archive without the core is useless.
- You can split the key and the core between different people for extra security.
- Plausible deniability: just remove the archive comment, and the core is irreversibly lost.
- The key and archive can be stored together without risk, as long as the `file_hash` is missing.

The final key for the archive is generated as:  
`final_key = SHA256(SHA256(answer1 + file_hash) + SHA256(answer2 + file_hash) + SHA256(answer3 + file_hash) + ...)`.

---

### 🔍 SHA256 Secure Mode Security Assessment
The SHA256 Secure Mode method combines AES-256-CBC and SHA-256, providing multi-layer protection. The final key is derived from the file hash (`file_hash`) and the user's answers, making brute-forcing the key virtually impossible without both components.

Thanks to its unique structure (combining answer1 + file_hash and an additional "payload"), this method resembles split-knowledge schemes but has no direct analogs among common solutions.

With properly chosen answers (strong passwords), the method offers a high level of cryptographic security and additional features, such as plausible deniability by removing the archive's comment.

# SecretMemoryLocker (SecretML v2.03)

**Your personal digital vault – protected by your memories.**

## 🆕 What's New in v2.03

Version 2.03 introduces a new `_info` field in `secret_data.json`, which contains metadata about the file format:  
`"_info": "SecretMemoryLocker v2.03 / Lite-SML"`.

All encrypted content is now stored under a unified `payload` field for better structure and future compatibility.

### New encryption methods:
- ✅ **Lite-SML** — a patented encryption method that does not require memorizing a password phrase.
- 🔧 **SHA256** — in development.
- 🔧 **BlockchainMode** — in development.
- 🔧 **TimeLock** — in development.

# SecretMemoryLocker (SecretML v1.05)

**Your personal digital vault – protected by your memories.**

🌐 Read this in: [Українська](README.uk.md)

---

## 📖 About the Project

**SecretMemoryLocker** is a unique offline tool that transforms your personal memories into an unbreakable encryption key. It's designed to securely archive sensitive data and ensure recovery in critical situations.

This guarantees that you — or trusted people like heirs — can access crucial information even if all other passwords are lost.

---

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **Creating a "Digital Will"**: Store instructions or recovery hints for loved ones in case of unexpected events.
- **Protecting Seed Phrases**: Securely store clues to a modified seed phrase (based on the **FakeSeed** concept) instead of saving the phrase itself in plain form.
- **Password Archiving**: Keep important but rarely used passwords safely encrypted.
- **Protecting Any Files**: Encrypt personal documents, images, or any digital data for long-term offline storage.

---

## 🤔 How It Works

1. **Create your questions** — Choose personal questions only you or your trusted ones would know (e.g. "Where did we first meet?", "What was the name of my first pet?").
2. **Enter your answers** — Provide the exact answers to those questions.
3. **Attach your files** — Upload any files you want to encrypt.
4. **Get your archive** — The app generates a unique key from your answers, encrypts everything using AES-256, and produces a protected `.zip` archive.

To decrypt, simply run the program again and enter the exact same answers.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Strong Encryption**: Uses the battle-tested AES-256 algorithm to protect your data.
- ✅ **Memory-Based Key**: The encryption key is generated from a combination of your answers — impossible to guess or brute-force without exact input.
- ✅ **Fully Offline**: No internet connection is required. Everything runs locally on your computer.
- ✅ **No Cloud, No Servers**: Your data stays 100% with you. Nothing is uploaded anywhere.
- ✅ **Simple Interface**: User-friendly window built with Python/Tkinter.
- ✅ **Two-Layer Data Separation**: The app creates two separate files — an encrypted `.zip` archive and a `.json` file with encrypted questions. You can store them in different places (e.g., give the `.json` to a trusted person and keep the `.zip` with the app in a bank vault). Without both files **and** the correct answers, access is impossible.
- 🎯 **Most important:** No keys are ever saved. The key is computed in real-time only when the correct answers are provided.

---

> ❗ **Note:** Windows Defender may show a warning about an "unknown publisher" — this is expected for unsigned apps. The file is safe.
