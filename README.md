What's New in v4.03 — Phantom-Step Cascade Key Derivation

### 🔑 Phantom-Step Cascade — Deterministic Final Key Generation

SecretMemoryLocker v4.03 introduces an enhanced key derivation model based on a chained Argon2 cascade.

**Core idea:**

- Initial seed: `k = file_hash_seed`
- Each secret answer is processed sequentially
- Every step re-derives the key using the previous result as salt
- Final output becomes the deterministic `final_key`

**Conceptually:**

```python
k = file_hash_seed

for answer in answers:
    k = Argon2(answer, salt=k)

final_key = k

```

### 🛡 What This Achieves
- Multi-layer entropy amplification  
- Order-dependent cryptographic strengthening  
- No stored master key  
- Deterministic and reproducible recovery  

This update strengthens resistance against brute-force and structural attacks while preserving full recoverability.

# 🚀 SecretMemoryLocker v4.02 — The Cognitive Challenge Update

>### 🎭 New Feature: The Vault Quest
We’ve included a pre-configured challenge to demonstrate our **Tri-State Security Logic**. Can you distinguish the truth from the mirage?

**How to test:**
1. **Download** the release and locate the `/Vault` folder.
2. **Launch** the app and click the **"Decrypt"** button.
3. **Select** `quest_protocol.json` and then select `SecretML_Vault.zip`.
4. **Navigate** the three-step cognitive filter:
    - **Truth Path:** Enter 100% accurate data to access the authentic `license.txt`.
    - **Decoy Path:** Enter "plausible" decoy answers to trigger a **Plausible Deniability** event. You'll unlock a **Honey-pot** file, designed to mislead intruders.
    - **MirageLoop:** Any other input leads to an infinite processing loop — wasting an attacker's time without giving away a single bit of error data.

💡 *SecretMemoryLocker — Where memory becomes a labyrinth and security is absolute.*

## 🚀 What's New in v3.15 — Memory-Sync & Chained Recovery

### 🧠 Memory-Sync (Derived Access Key)
SecretML can now **derive and securely store a session master key** based on your answers — without ever saving the answers themselves.

- One **non-reversible 256-bit Master-Hash**
- Stored securely in the system keyring
- Enables instant access to multiple archives without re-entering answers

---

### 🔐 Per-Archive Unique Encryption
Every encrypted file receives its **own unique password**, even within the same session.

- Archive key = `SHA256(MasterHash + FileHash)`
- File hash is stored in archive metadata (comment)
- No two archives ever share the same encryption key

---

### ⛓ Chained Recovery (Memory Path Protection)
Access to the Master-Key is protected by a **recursive question–answer chain**.

- Each answer decrypts the next step
- No visible structure or plaintext questions
- Partial knowledge is useless

You don’t enter a password —  
**you unlock your own memory.**

---

### 🛡 Zero-Knowledge Security Model
- Answers are **never stored**
- Only derived hashes exist
- Keyring data can be wiped instantly via UI

---

### 🧨 Instant Access Revocation
Removing archive metadata immediately breaks access —  
even if the Master-Key still exists.

A true **cryptographic kill-switch**.

---

## 🧪 Status
- Stable Windows build
- No KDF (test version)
- Ready for real-world usage & testing

**How it works**:  
- Combines your secret answers + the encrypted file hash (as salt).  
- Produces unique, instantly reproducible passwords for any resource.  

**Steps to use**:  
1. Activate PRO mode.  
2. Select your `*_SMLkey.json` key-file.  
3. Answer your secret questions.  
4. Enter the resource name (e.g. `GMAIL.COM`, `FACEBOOK.COM`).  
5. Get your password instantly.  

---

### 🔐 Password Formats
- **SHA-256 (64 chars)** — maximum entropy, hexadecimal string.  
- **SML-Echo (32 chars)** — mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers.  

---

### 📌 Key Rules for Resource Names
- **Exact input matters** — same name = same password, even small changes break consistency.  
- **Case insensitive** — `facebook.com` = `FACEBOOK.COM`.  
- **Keep it simple** — e.g. use just `GMAIL.COM`.  

---

### 🛡 Why Memory Echo?
- **On-the-fly** — passwords never stored, exist only during generation.  
- **Offline mode** — once activated, no internet is needed.  
- **Total control** — only you, with answers + key-file, can restore passwords.  

💡 **Pro Tip**: Use Memory Echo to create your **master password** (e.g. for Google Account).

Fixes & Improvements:

🧩 Fixed UTF-8 filename issue when extracting files with non-Latin characters (e.g., Cyrillic).

📐 Fixed window sizing bug for smaller screen resolutions and DPI settings.

---

## 🆕 What's New in v2.11

🦾 🔒 Version 2.11 introduces a new encryption method **SHA256 Secure Mode-SML**, a patented encryption system that does not require memorizing a password phrase.

### Key features:
- The encryption process uses both the hash of the file (`file_hash`) and your answers.
- Security is independent of the question length — without the core (`file_hash`), brute-force is impossible.
- `file_hash` is stored in the ZIP archive comment as a separate key in the format **SHA256:<hash>**.
- Think of the JSON file as the key and the archive comment as the lock's core — without the core, the lock cannot be opened.
- All data is securely locked: having the JSON and archive without the core is useless.
- You can split the key and the core between different people for extra security.
- Plausible deniability: just remove the archive comment, and the core is irreversibly lost.
- The key and archive can be stored together without risk, as long as the `file_hash` is missing.

The final key for the archive is generated as:  
`final_key = SHA256(SHA256(answer1 + file_hash) + SHA256(answer2 + file_hash) + SHA256(answer3 + file_hash) + ...)`.

---

### 🔍 SHA256 Secure Mode Security Assessment
The SHA256 Secure Mode method combines AES-256-CBC and SHA-256, providing multi-layer protection. The final key is derived from the file hash (`file_hash`) and the user's answers, making brute-forcing the key virtually impossible without both components.

Thanks to its unique structure (combining answer1 + file_hash and an additional "payload"), this method resembles split-knowledge schemes but has no direct analogs among common solutions.

With properly chosen answers (strong passwords), the method offers a high level of cryptographic security and additional features, such as plausible deniability by removing the archive's comment.

# SecretMemoryLocker (SecretML v1.05)

**Your personal digital vault – protected by your memories.**

🌐 Read this in: [Українська](README.uk.md)

---

## 📖 About the Project

**SecretMemoryLocker** is a unique offline tool that transforms your personal memories into an unbreakable encryption key. It's designed to securely archive sensitive data and ensure recovery in critical situations.

This guarantees that you — or trusted people like heirs — can access crucial information even if all other passwords are lost.

---

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **Creating a "Digital Will"**: Store instructions or recovery hints for loved ones in case of unexpected events.
- **Protecting Seed Phrases**: Securely store clues to a modified seed phrase (based on the **FakeSeed** concept) instead of saving the phrase itself in plain form.
- **Password Archiving**: Keep important but rarely used passwords safely encrypted.
- **Protecting Any Files**: Encrypt personal documents, images, or any digital data for long-term offline storage.

---

## 🤔 How It Works

1. **Create your questions** — Choose personal questions only you or your trusted ones would know (e.g. "Where did we first meet?", "What was the name of my first pet?").
2. **Enter your answers** — Provide the exact answers to those questions.
3. **Attach your files** — Upload any files you want to encrypt.
4. **Get your archive** — The app generates a unique key from your answers, encrypts everything using AES-256, and produces a protected `.zip` archive.

To decrypt, simply run the program again and enter the exact same answers.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Strong Encryption**: Uses the battle-tested AES-256 algorithm to protect your data.
- ✅ **Memory-Based Key**: The encryption key is generated from a combination of your answers — impossible to guess or brute-force without exact input.
- ✅ **Fully Offline**: No internet connection is required. Everything runs locally on your computer.
- ✅ **No Cloud, No Servers**: Your data stays 100% with you. Nothing is uploaded anywhere.
- ✅ **Simple Interface**: User-friendly window built with Python/Tkinter.
- ✅ **Two-Layer Data Separation**: The app creates two separate files — an encrypted `.zip` archive and a `.json` file with encrypted questions. You can store them in different places (e.g., give the `.json` to a trusted person and keep the `.zip` with the app in a bank vault). Without both files **and** the correct answers, access is impossible.
- 🎯 **Most important:** No keys are ever saved. The key is computed in real-time only when the correct answers are provided.

---

> ❗ **Note:** Windows Defender may show a warning about an "unknown publisher" — this is expected for unsigned apps. The file is safe.
