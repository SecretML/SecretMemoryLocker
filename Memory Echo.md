# ‚ú® Feature: Memory Echo

**Status:** Coming soon (internal testing phase)  

### Overview
**Memory Echo** is a unique, recoverable password system inspired by cryptographic seed phrases (similar to BIP32/BIP39/BIP44 in Bitcoin).  
Instead of storing passwords, a **final_key** is dynamically generated from your personal security questions and answers. This key can then be used to generate unique passwords for any service.

### How it works
1. Users provide a set of personal questions and answers.  
2. A **final_key** is derived from these responses.  
3. For each service, a password is generated deterministically using the **final_key**, the service name, and an optional index to allow multiple passwords per service.  
4. The result can be formatted as needed (letters, numbers, special characters).  

### Key Benefits
- üîê **Zero-storage**: passwords are never stored, only generated on the fly.  
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Deterministic**: any password can be recovered using the same security answers.  
- üß© **Scalable**: generate an unlimited number of unique passwords for all accounts.  
- üîë **Crypto-inspired**: works like an HD wallet, but for passwords.  

### Planned Additions
- Password format configurator (length, characters, symbols).  
- Integration with other features (e.g., **SML-Seed**).  
- Option to generate cryptocurrency addresses from the same **final_key**.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The buttons for **Memory Echo** are already in the GUI, but the functionality is still under internal testing.
